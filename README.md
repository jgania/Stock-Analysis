# Stock-Analysis
Preforming analysis on refactoring VBA code using Stock Analysis data.

## Results

Overall stock perfomance in green stocks was much stronger in 2017 than in 2018 with the exception of TerraForm Power (TERP) stock which only saw a minimal change of 2% YOY. Overall really found this challenge to be rewarding. I really like the in depth explanation in the modulal and the ability to take a look and refractor the code into being more efficient. Overall the refractored code is 1250% faster than the Module 2 time outputs. See attatched files for run-time tests.

### Data
Refractored Code Run-Time: 0.03125 seconds
Module 2 Code Run-Time: 0.390625 seconds 

##Summary
A couple advantaged of refactoring code include easier maintainance of the code, improved legibility, as well as the ability to write more efficient and cleaner code as outlined in this excersize.

Some dissadvantaged of refactoring code include additional debuggin steps as a result of code minipulation, more efficient code could be more comprehensive and harder to follow, as well as coordination amoungst a team to efficiently communicate and refactor the code. 

What I noticed is that the process of refactoring our original code took quite a bit of time to complete. The old addage goes "If it isn't broken, don't fix it". that being said, I feel like when we start using larger datasets the run-time and efficiency of our pipelines will make a larger difference.
